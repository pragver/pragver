project, you are expected to comply with it and treat everyone respectfully.

### Community

Discussions about the PragVer specification take place on this repository's
[Issues](https://github.com/pragver/pragver/issues) and
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/pragver/pragver/pulls) sections. Anybody is
welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels,
including contacting the maintainer directly. Keeping communication public means
everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.


### Style Guide

#### Text Files

- The file encoding must be [**UTF-8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).
- Line endings must be **Unix-style** (LF), as opposed to Windows-style (CRLF)
  or Macintosh-style (CR). Git should handle this automatically for you via the
  project `.gitattributes` file.
- **Trailing white space should be removed** from the end of lines.
- Lines should **word-wrap** at a non-strict 120 character length limit.
  Exceptions can be made for things like readability.

#### Documentation Format

- All documentation must be written in
  [**Markdown format**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) adhering to
  [**CommonMark specification**](http://commonmark.org/).
- [**Kramdown**](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) extensions may be used.
- Specification files must contain a YAML
  [**front matter block**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

#### Content Principles

- **Approachability**: Don't assume reader has prior knowledge.
- **Brevity**: Keep it simple, link to outside content for deeper dives.
- **Curation**: Amplify community best practices vs. any individual's point of
  view.
