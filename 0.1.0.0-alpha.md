## Summary

This specification describes a set of rules and requirements that dictate how
each [version identifier] must be [bumped] and assigned to [releases], in a way
that communicates the kind of [modifications] that were done to a versioned
[artifact].

A minimal [version identifier] takes the form `GRADE.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and is
[bumped] by incrementing:

- The [Grade Number], when any [disruptive modifications] are released.
- The [Major Number], when any [backwards-incompatible modifications] are
  released.
- The [Minor Number], when any [backwards-compatible alterations] are released.
- The [Patch Number], when only [backwards-compatible corrections] are released.

Optional [Metadata] containing additional information associated to the release
or the build take the respective forms `-RELEASE.METADATA` and `+BUILD.METADATA`
and can be appended to a minimal [version identifier].

</div></div>



## Scope

*Pragmatic Versioning* **MUST** be applied only to versionable [artifacts] that
can evolve over time and meet the following requirements.


### Artifacts

- A versioned [artifact] **MUST** comprise a set of features or characteristics
  that represents a public contract between the [providers] and the [consumers]
  of the artifact.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>A public API, a software package or library in either source code or
  >   binary format.</ins>
  > - <ins>A text document describing a protocol, specification or other type of
  >   technical standard.</ins>

- The [providers] of the [artifact] **MUST** declare that it is using
  *Pragmatic Versioning* and **SHOULD** provide a link to this specification.

  > ###### Example
  > - <ins>This software adheres to
  >   [Pragmatic Versioning](https://pragver.github.io/).</ins>


### Features

- The nature of the features **MAY** depend on the type of artifact, but they
  **SHOULD** be as precise and comprehensive as possible.
- The features **SHALL** be modified by means of:
  - **Corrections**: modifications that **SHALL** only fix incorrect features.
  - **Alterations**: any other modifications that **MAY** replace or remove
    existing features from the artifact, or add new features to it.


### Modifications

- The modifications **MUST** be describable in terms of backwards-compatibility:

  - **Backwards-compatible modifications** (also known as *internal changes*):
    the outside of the modified [artifact] is *indistinguishable* from the
    unmodified artifact, or *interchangeable*.

    > ###### Examples
    > - <ins>Adding a new public interface in an API.</ins>
    > - <ins>Renaming a local variable in a private method of an
    >   application.</ins>
    > - <ins>Removing a private method of a software library.</ins>
    > - <ins>Marking any public functionality as deprecated.</ins>

  - **Backwards-incompatible modifications** (also known as *external changes*):
    the outside of the modified [artifact] is *easily distinguishable* from the
    unmodified artifact, or *not completely interchangeable*.

    > ###### Examples
    > - <ins>Renaming a public method of a software library.</ins>
    > - <ins>Removing a public class in an API.</ins>

  - **Disruptive modifications** (also known as *structural changes*): the
    modified [artifact] is *totally different* from the unmodified artifact, or
    *not at all interchangeable*.

    > ###### Examples
    > - <ins>Making a big change of semantics in a software library.</ins>
    > - <ins>Changing the paradigm of a software framework.</ins>
    > - <ins>A change of the releasing policy.</ins>
    > - <ins>A complete overhaul of the codebase.</ins>

- The rules that determine the backwards-compatibility level of the
  modifications **MAY** depend on the type of the artifact. If the implications
  are not completely obvious, then the [providers] of the [artifact] **SHOULD**
  explain them in detail, next to the declaration of use of
  *Pragmatic Versioning*.

    > ###### Examples
    > - <ins>The document "Requirements Analysis" uses
    >   [Pragmatic Versioning](https://pragver.github.io/):</ins>
    >   - **Fixing typos** or **styling the document** are considered
    >     backwards-compatible corrections.
    >   - Adding new **optional requirements** or **recommendations** are
    >     considered backwards-compatible alterations.
    >   - Rephrasing or altering in any way **existing requirements** are
    >     considered backwards-incompatible changes.
    >   - **Adding new** requirements or prohibitions, or
    >     **removing existing ones** are considered disruptive changes.

## Releases

Releases are the only mechanism by which any modifications of the [artifact]
**MUST** be published.

- Each new release **MUST** be assigned a new, unique [version identifier].
- Releases **MUST** be *immutable*: once a release has been published, its
  contents **MUST NOT** be modified.


### Initial Stages

- During the first iterations of the process, the releases **MAY** be unstable:
  - Releases could contain mistakes or errors.
  - Releases could not be ready to be used in production environments.
  - Releases could suffer continuous changes.
- The [providers] of the [artifact] **MUST** convey such situation to
  [consumers] by using a [Grade Number] of zero.
- The first unstable release **MUST** be assigned to a [version identifier]
  `0.1.0.0` (additional metadata **MAY** be appended).
- The next [version identifier] will be [bumped] normally, as per the rules
  described later in this specification. Eventually, the releases will progress
  to maturity and the first stable release will be published.


### Stable Releases

- The [providers] of the [artifact] **SHOULD** strive to publish stable
  releases:
  - Releases **MUST NOT** contain mistakes or errors, to the best of their
    knowledge.
  - Releases **MUST** be ready to be used in production environments.
  - Releases **MUST** carefully evolve the versioned artifact.
- The first stable release **MUST** be assigned to a [version identifier]
  `1.0.0.0` (additional metadata **MAY** be appended).
- The next [version identifier] will be [bumped] normally, as per the rules
  described later in this specification.


### Pre-releases

Pre-releases are useful for demonstration and preview purposes before an actual
release is published. Typically they have names such as Alpha, Beta, etc. and
they are considered unstable by definition.

- [Pre-releases] **MUST** include [Release Metadata] to indicate that they
  **MAY** not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by
  their associated minimal version identifier.


## Version Identifiers

Version identifiers are unique, textual values that **MUST** be assigned to
releases so that they can be easily tracked down and distinguished from one
another.


### Minimal Format

- A minimal [version identifier] **MUST** take the form
  `GRADE.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where **GRADE**, **MAJOR**, **MINOR** and **PATCH**
  are dot separated, non-negative integers, and **MUST NOT** contain leading
  zeroes.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.2.3.4`</ins>
  > - <ins>`8.16.0.64`</ins>
  > - <ins>`3.14.1.592`</ins>
  > - <del>`1.02.3.4`</del>
  > - <del>`1.2.-3.4`</del>
  > - <del>`1.00.3.4`</del>

- Each element **SHALL** either increase numerically or reset to zero.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.9.3.5` can be bumped to `1.9.3.6`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.9.3.6` can be bumped to `1.9.4.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.9.4.0` can be bumped to `1.10.0.0`</ins>
  > - <del>`1.10.0.0` cannot be bumped to `1.12.0.0`</del>
  > - <del>`1.10.0.0` cannot be bumped to `1.10.5.5`</del>
  > - <del>`1.10.0.0` cannot be bumped to `1.9.0.0`</del>

- Identifiers containing both [Grade Number] and [Major Number] equal to zero
  are reserved and **MUST NOT** be assigned to releases, neither stable nor
  unstable.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`0.1.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`0.8.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0`</ins>
  > - <del>`0.0.0.0`</del>
  > - <del>`0.0.0.1`</del>
  > - <del>`0.0.1.1`</del>


### Metadata Format

There are two types of metadata that **MAY** be appended to a minimal
[version identifier] to convey additional information:


#### Release Metadata

- [Release Metadata] **MAY** be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of
  dot separated identifiers to a minimal [version identifier] (immediately
  following the [Patch Number]):
  - Textual identifiers **MUST NOT** be empty and **SHALL** comprise only ASCII
    alphanumerics and hyphen `[0-9A-Za-z-]`.
  - Numeric identifiers **MUST NOT** include leading zeroes.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-ALPHA.1`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.2.3.4-1.beta.0.32`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.2.3.4-SNAPSHOT.128.develop-branch`</ins>
  > - <del>`1.0.0.0=alpha.1`</del>
  > - <del>`1.0.0.0-alpha;1`</del>
  > - <del>`1.0.0.0-@lpha.1`</del>

#### Build Metadata

- [Build Metadata] **MAY** be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of
  dot separated identifiers immediately following the [Patch Number] or
  [Release Metadata]:
  - Textual identifiers **MUST NOT** be empty and **SHALL** comprise only ASCII
  alphanumerics and hyphen `[0-9A-Za-z-]`.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0+linux`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha+linux`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.2.3.4-beta.512+linux-386.desktop.1024`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.2.3.4+linux.zaragoza.19980425-123000`</ins>
  > - <del>`1.0.0.0#linux`</del>
  > - <del>`1.0.0.0-alpha+linux!`</del>
  > - <del>`1.0.0.0-alpha+linux:386`</del>


### Bumping Rules

Each new release **SHALL** be assigned to a unique [version identifier] that
will depend on two factors:

- The [version identifier] of the previous release, which will be used as the
  base.
- The backwards-compatibility level of the modifications introduced by the new
  release.


#### Grade Number

1. [Grade Number] **MUST** be incremented if any [disruptive modifications] are
   introduced.
2. [Patch Number], [Minor Number] and [Major Number] **SHALL** be reset to zero
   when [Grade Number] is incremented.


#### Major Number

1. [Major Number] **MUST** be incremented if any
   [backwards-incompatible modifications] are introduced.
2. [Patch Number] and [Minor Number] **SHALL** be reset to zero when
   [Major Number] is incremented.
3. [Grade Number] **SHALL** be left unchanged.


#### Minor Number

1. [Minor Number] **MUST** be incremented if any
   [backwards-compatible alterations] are introduced.
2. [Patch Number] **SHALL** be reset to zero when [Minor Number] is incremented.
3. [Major Number] and [Grade Number] **SHALL** be left unchanged.


#### Patch Number

1. [Patch Number] **MUST** be incremented if only
   [backwards-compatible corrections] are introduced.
2. [Minor Number], [Major Number] and [Grade Number] **SHALL** be left
   unchanged.


### Precedence

Precedence refers to how version identifiers are compared to each other when
ordered.

- Precedence **MUST** be calculated by separating (and ordering) the
  [version identifier] into:
  1. [Grade Number]
  2. [Major Number]
  3. [Minor Number]
  4. [Patch Number]
  5. [Release Metadata]

- [Build Metadata] **SHOULD** be ignored when determining version precedence.
  Thus two [version identifiers] that differ only in the [Build Metadata], have
  the same precedence.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0+debian.amd64` has the same precedence as
  >   `1.0.0.0+debian.x86`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha+100` has the same precedence as
  >   `1.0.0.0-alpha+999`</ins>

- Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing each of these
  identifiers from left to right as follows: [Grade Number], [Major Number],
  [Minor Number] and [Patch Number] are always compared numerically.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0` comes before `2.0.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`2.0.0.0` comes before `2.1.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`2.1.0.0` comes before `2.1.1.0`</ins>

- When [Grade Number], [Major Number], [Minor Number] and [Patch Number] are
  equal, a [version identifier] that includes [Release Metadata] **SHALL** have
  lower precedence than its associated minimal [version identifier].

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha` comes before `1.0.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-1` comes before `1.0.0.0`</ins>

- Precedence for two [version identifiers] that include [Release Metadata] and
  with the same [Grade Number], [Major Number], [Minor Number] and
  [Patch Number] **MUST** be determined by comparing each dot separated
  identifier, from left to right, until a difference is found as follows:
  - Numeric identifiers (consisting of only digits) **SHALL** be compared
    numerically
  - Textual identifiers (with letters or hyphens) **SHALL** be compared
    lexically in ASCII sort order.
  - Numeric identifiers **SHALL** have lower precedence than textual
    identifiers.
  - A smaller set of [Release Metadata] identifiers **SHALL** have lower
    precedence than a larger set, provided that all of the preceding identifiers
    are equal.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha`      comes before `1.0.0.0-alpha.1`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha.1`    comes before `1.0.0.0-alpha.beta`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha.beta` comes before `1.0.0.0-beta`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-beta`       comes before `1.0.0.0-beta.2`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-beta.2`     comes before `1.0.0.0-beta.11`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-beta.11`    comes before `1.0.0.0-rc.1`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-rc.1`       comes before `1.0.0.0`</ins>

##### Providers

The providers of an [artifact] are in charge of publishing new releases.
Typically they are the ones who develop and integrate corrections and
alterations.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>Maintainers of a software library.</ins>
> - <ins>Authors and editors of a protocol, specification or other type of
>   technical standard.</ins>

By adhering to *Pragmatic Versioning*, they express their commitment to publish
new [releases] with a [version identifier] that follows the rules described in
this specification.


##### Consumers

The consumers of a versioned [artifact] depend on it to achieve their goals.
Typically they react to [releases] by deciding whether to use the new version of
the [artifact] or not.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>Developers of a software application that depends on a third-party
>   library.</ins>
> - <ins>Implementors of a protocol, specification or other type of technical
>   standard.</ins>

They have to be extra careful when [backwards-incompatible modifications] are
introduced, that's why it is so crucial that published [releases] follow the
rules specified in *Pragmatic Versioning*.

### Perl Compatible Regular Expression

PCRE for valid PragVer version identifiers:

```
(?P<grade>0|[1-9]+\d*)\.(?P<major>0|[1-9]+\d*)\.(?P<minor>0|[1-9]+\d*)\.(?P<patch>0|[1-9]+\d*)(?:-(?P<release_metadata>(?:[A-Za-z0-9-])+(?:\.(?:[A-Za-z0-9-])+)*))?(?:\+(?P<build_metadata>(?:[A-Za-z0-9-])+(?:\.(?:[A-Za-z0-9-])+)*))?
```
