## Summary

This specification describes a set of rules and requirements that dictate how
[versions] must be [bumped] and assigned to [releases], in a way that
communicates the kind of [modifications] that were done to a versioned
[artifact].

A minimal version identifier takes the form `GRADE.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and is
[bumped] by incrementing:

- **[GRADE]** number when any [disruptive modifications] are released.
- **[MAJOR]** number when any [backward-incompatible modifications] are
  released.
- **[MINOR]** number when any [backward-compatible alterations] are released.
- **[PATCH]** number when only [backward-compatible corrections] are released.

Optional [metadata] containing additional information associated with the
release or the build can be appended, taking the respective forms
`-RELEASE.METADATA` and `+BUILD.METADATA`.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14] [RFC 2119] [RFC 8174]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

</div></div>


## Scope

- Versionable [artifacts] MUST include a set of public [features] that can
  undergo [modifications] over time.
- New [releases] containing [corrections] or other [alterations] SHALL be issued
  by the [publishers] of the artifact.
- [Subscribers] SHOULD express their interest in released versions of the
  artifact by means of a [subscription].


## Artifacts

A versioned [artifact] MUST comprise a set of public [features] or
characteristics that represents a public contract between the [publishers] and
the [subscribers] of the artifact.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>A public API, a software package or library in either source code or
>   binary format.</ins>
> - <ins>A text document describing a protocol, specification, or other type of
>   technical standard.</ins>
> - <ins>A database schema, a logical entityâ€“relationship model, or a conceptual
>   data model.</ins>


### Features

- The nature of the features MAY depend on the type of the artifact, but they
  SHOULD be as precise and comprehensive as possible.
- The features SHALL be modified by means of:
  - **Corrections**: modifications that SHALL only fix incorrect features.
  - **Alterations**: any other modifications that MAY replace or remove existing
    features from the artifact, or add new features to it.


### Modifications

- The modifications MUST be describable in terms of backward-compatibility.
- The rules that determine the backward-compatibility level of the modifications
  MAY depend on the type of the artifact.
- If the implications are not completely obvious, then the [publishers] of the
  [artifact] SHOULD explain them in detail.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>The document "Requirements Analysis" uses
  >   [Pragmatic Versioning](https://pragver.github.io/):</ins>
  >   - **Fixing typos** or **styling the document** are considered
  >     backward-compatible corrections.
  >   - Adding new **optional requirements** or **recommendations** are
  >     considered backward-compatible alterations.
  >   - Rephrasing or altering in any way **existing requirements** are
  >     considered backward-incompatible changes.
  >   - **Adding new** requirements or prohibitions, or
  >     **removing existing ones** are considered disruptive changes.


#### Backward-Compatible Corrections

- Also known as *fixing changes*.
- The modified [artifact] SHALL only include modifications that rectify
  incorrect features.
- Looking from the outside, the modified [artifact] SHALL be *indistinguishable*
  from the unmodified artifact, or *interchangeable*.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>Fixing a bug in a software library.</ins>
> - <ins>Removing some typos from a protocol specification.</ins>
> - <ins>Styling the document that defines a technical standard.</ins>


#### Backward-Compatible Alterations

- Also known as *internal changes*.
- The modified [artifact] MAY as well include corrections but MUST include other
  alterations.
- Looking from the outside, the modified [artifact] SHALL be *indistinguishable*
  from the unmodified artifact, or *interchangeable*.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>Adding a new public interface in an API.</ins>
> - <ins>Renaming a local variable in a private method of an application.</ins>
> - <ins>Removing a private method of a software library.</ins>
> - <ins>Marking any public functionality as deprecated.</ins>


#### Backward-Incompatible Modifications

- Also known as *external changes*.
- Looking from the outside, the modified [artifact] SHALL be *distinguishable*
  from the unmodified artifact, or *not completely interchangeable*.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>Renaming a public method of a software library.</ins>
> - <ins>Removing a public class in an API.</ins>


#### Disruptive Modifications

- Also known as *structural changes*.
- The modified [artifact] SHALL be *totally different* from the unmodified
  artifact, or *not at all interchangeable*.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>Making a big change of semantics in a software library.</ins>
> - <ins>Changing the paradigm of a software framework.</ins>
> - <ins>A change of the releasing policy.</ins>
> - <ins>A complete overhaul of the codebase.</ins>


## Versions

Versions are unique, textual identifiers composed of a REQUIRED [core] and an
OPTIONAL [metadata] that MUST be assigned to [releases] so that they can be
clearly tracked down and distinguished from one another.


### Core

- The core of a version MUST take the form `GRADE.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where
  **GRADE**, **MAJOR**, **MINOR**, and **PATCH** are dot-separated, non-negative
  integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.2.3.4`</ins>
  > - <ins>`8.16.0.64`</ins>
  > - <ins>`3.14.1.592`</ins>
  > - <del>`1.02.3.4`</del>
  > - <del>`1.2.-3.4`</del>
  > - <del>`1.00.3.4`</del>

- Versions containing both **GRADE** and **MAJOR** numbers equal to zero are
  not valid and MUST NOT be assigned to any releases.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`0.1.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`0.8.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0`</ins>
  > - <del>`0.0.0.0`</del>
  > - <del>`0.0.0.1`</del>
  > - <del>`0.0.1.1`</del>


### Metadata

- Two types of metadata MAY be appended to the [core]
  (immediately following **[PATCH]** number) to convey additional information.
- When both of them are appended, [release metadata] MUST precede
  [build metadata].


#### Release Metadata

Release metadata MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen `-` and a series of
dot-separated, non-empty identifiers:

- Numeric identifiers SHALL comprise only ASCII numbers `[0-9]` and MUST NOT
  include leading zeroes.
- Textual identifiers SHALL comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen
  `[0-9A-Za-z-]`.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha`</ins>
> - <ins>`1.0.0.0-ALPHA.1`</ins>
> - <ins>`1.2.3.4-1.beta.0.32`</ins>
> - <ins>`1.2.3.4-SNAPSHOT.128.develop-branch`</ins>
> - <del>`1.0.0.0=alpha.1`</del>
> - <del>`1.0.0.0-alpha;1`</del>
> - <del>`1.0.0.0-@lpha.1`</del>


#### Build Metadata

Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign `+` and a series of
dot-separated, non-empty identifiers:

- Textual identifiers SHALL comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen
  `[0-9A-Za-z-]`.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>`1.0.0.0+linux`</ins>
> - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha+linux`</ins>
> - <ins>`1.2.3.4-beta.512+linux-386.desktop.1024`</ins>
> - <ins>`1.2.3.4+linux.zaragoza.19980425-123000`</ins>
> - <del>`1.0.0.0#linux`</del>
> - <del>`1.0.0.0-alpha+linux!`</del>
> - <del>`1.0.0.0-alpha+linux:386`</del>


### Precedence

Precedence refers to how [versions] are compared to each other when ordered.

- Before comparing two [versions], they SHALL be split into **[GRADE]**,
  **[MAJOR]**, **[MINOR]**, **[PATCH]**, and [release metadata].

- Precedence MUST be determined by the first difference when comparing each of
  the numbers from left to right: **[GRADE]**, **[MAJOR]**, **[MINOR]**, and
  **[PATCH]**.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0` comes before `2.0.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`2.0.0.0` comes before `2.1.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`2.1.0.0` comes before `2.1.1.0`</ins>

- When the numbers are equal, a [version] that includes [release metadata] SHALL
  have lower precedence.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha` comes before `1.0.0.0`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-1`     comes before `1.0.0.0`</ins>

- Precedence for two [versions] that have the same numbers and include
  [release metadata] MUST be determined by comparing each dot-separated
  identifier, from left to right, until a difference is found:
  - Numeric identifiers SHALL be compared numerically.
  - Textual identifiers SHALL be compared lexically in ASCII sort order.
  - Numeric identifiers SHALL have lower precedence than textual identifiers.
  - A smaller set of [release metadata] identifiers SHALL have lower precedence
    than a larger set, provided that all of the preceding identifiers are equal.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha`      comes before `1.0.0.0-alpha.1`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha.1`    comes before `1.0.0.0-alpha.beta`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha.beta` comes before `1.0.0.0-beta`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-beta`       comes before `1.0.0.0-beta.2`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-beta.2`     comes before `1.0.0.0-beta.11`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-beta.11`    comes before `1.0.0.0-rc.1`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-rc.1`       comes before `1.0.0.0`</ins>

- [Build metadata] SHOULD be ignored when determining version precedence.
  Thus two [versions] that differ only in the [build metadata], have the same
  precedence.

  > ###### Examples
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0+debian.amd64` has the same precedence as `1.0.0.0+debian.x86`</ins>
  > - <ins>`1.0.0.0-alpha+100`    has the same precedence as `1.0.0.0-alpha+999`</ins>


### Bumping Rules

- Each new [release] SHALL be assigned to a unique [version] that will depend on
  two factors:
  - The version [core] of the previous [release] SHALL be used as the base.
  - The backward-compatibility level of the modifications introduced by the new
    release SHALL determine the bump type.
- Each numeric element SHALL either increase numerically or reset to zero.
- [Release metadata] and [build metadata] MAY be arbitrarily modified.


#### Grade Bump

1. **[GRADE]** number MUST be incremented if the [release] introduces any
   [disruptive modifications].
2. **[PATCH]**, **[MINOR]**, and **[MAJOR]** numbers SHALL be reset to zero.


#### Major Bump

1. **[MAJOR]** number MUST be incremented if the [release] introduces any
   [backward-incompatible modifications].
2. **[PATCH]** and **[MINOR]** numbers SHALL be reset to zero.
3. **[GRADE]** number SHALL be left unchanged.


#### Minor Bump

1. **[MINOR]** number MUST be incremented if the [release] introduces any
   [backward-compatible alterations].
2. **[PATCH]** number SHALL be reset to zero.
3. **[MAJOR]** and **[GRADE]** numbers SHALL be left unchanged.


#### Patch Bump

1. **[PATCH]** number MUST be incremented if the [release] introduces only
   [backward-compatible corrections].
2. **[MINOR]**, **[MAJOR]**, and **[GRADE]** numbers SHALL be left unchanged.


## Publishers

The publishers of an [artifact] are committed to publishing new [releases] with
a [version] that follows the rules described in this specification.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>Maintainers of a software library.</ins>
> - <ins>Authors and editors of a protocol, specification or other type of
>   technical standard.</ins>

- Publishers of an [artifact] SHALL be in charge of publishing new [releases]
  and MAY also be the ones who develop and integrate corrections and
  alterations.

- Publishers SHOULD strive to publish [stable releases].

- Publishers MUST declare that they adhere to *Pragmatic Versioning* and SHOULD
  provide a link to this specification.

  > ###### Example
  > - <ins>This software adheres to
  >   [Pragmatic Versioning](https://pragver.github.io/).</ins>


### Releases

Releases are the only mechanism by which any modifications of the [artifact]
SHALL be published.

- Each new release MUST be assigned a new, unique [version].
- Releases MUST be *immutable*: once a release is published, its contents
  MUST NOT be modified.


#### Initial Stages

- During the first iterations of the development process, the releases MAY be
  unstable, which means that [artifacts] MAY:
  - Contain mistakes or errors.
  - Not be ready to be used in production environments.
  - Suffer continuous changes.
- The [publishers] MUST convey this situation to [subscribers] by using a
  **[GRADE]** of zero.
- The first unstable release MUST be assigned to [version] `0.1.0.0`
  (additional [metadata] MAY be appended).
- The next [version] will be [bumped] normally, as per the rules described
  earlier in this specification. Eventually, the releases will progress to
  maturity and the first stable release will be published.


#### Stable Releases

- After the first iterations of the process, the releases SHOULD be stable:
  - Releases MUST NOT contain mistakes or errors, to the best of [publishers]
    knowledge.
  - Releases MUST be ready to be used in production environments.
  - Releases MUST carefully evolve the versioned artifact.
- The first stable release MUST be assigned to [version] `1.0.0.0`
  (additional [metadata] MAY be appended).
- The next [version] will be [bumped] normally, as per the rules described later
  in this specification.


#### Pre-releases

Pre-releases are useful for demonstration and preview purposes before an actual
release is published. Typically they have names such as Alpha or Beta. They are
considered [unstable] by definition.

- Pre-releases MUST include [release metadata] to indicate that they MAY not
  satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by their [core].


## Subscribers

Subscribers of an [artifact] depend on its [releases] to achieve their goals and
they usually have to be extra careful when [backward-incompatible modifications]
are introduced.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>Developers of a software application that depends on a third-party
>   library.</ins>
> - <ins>Implementors of a protocol, specification or other type of technical
>   standard.</ins>

- Subscribers MUST make sure that the versioned [artifact] adheres to
  *Pragmatic Versioning*.

- They MAY react to new [releases] by deciding whether to use or not new
  [versions] of the [artifact]:
  - Most subscribers SHOULD define a [subscription] to express a subset of the
    [releases] in which they are interested.
  - Some others MAY decide to stay locked on a specific version.
  - And some others might want to use *any* newly released [version]
    (NOT RECOMMENDED).

- They SHOULD rely on *automated tools* such as *dependency managers* to keep
  their upstream dependencies up to date.
  - Those tools SHALL determine the most appropriate [release] available
    according to the [subscription].


### Subscriptions

Subscriptions provide a systematic way of finding the most up-to-date [release]
in which a [subscriber] is interested.

- A subscription MUST be represented as a character string.
- Whitespace SHALL be ignored.
- It MUST be denoted as a list of zero or more double-pipe-separated `||`
  [selectors].
- Given a list of released [versions] of an [artifact], the most suitable one
  MUST be selected as follows:

  - If the subscription contains any [selectors]:
    1. All [selectors] MUST evaluate all the available [versions].
    2. Each [selector] SHALL nominate at most one candidate [version].
    3. The one with the greatest precedence MUST be selected.
    4. In case there are several of them with the greatest precedence, the one
       nominated by the leftmost [selector] SHALL be selected.

  - If the [selector] list is empty (NOT RECOMMENDED):
    1. The [version] with the greatest precedence of all available [releases]
       (excluding [pre-releases]) MUST be selected.
    2. In case there are several of them with the greatest precedence, the one
       without [build metadata] SHOULD be selected.


#### Selectors

Selectors help evaluate a list of [versions] and nominate one possible choice.

- Selectors MUST be composed of three OPTIONAL lists of comparators, in this
  order:
  1. [Core Comparators]
  2. [Release Comparators]
  3. [Build Comparators]
- At least one of these lists MUST be specified and they SHALL NOT be empty when
  present.
- A selector SHALL find the [versions] that satisfy all comparators and then
  SHALL nominate the one with the greatest precedence.
- If the list of [release comparators] is absent, then all [pre-releases] MUST
  be excluded from nomination.
- If the list of [build comparators] is absent and there are several [versions]
  with the greatest precedence, the one without [build metadata] SHOULD be
  selected.


##### Core Comparators

Core comparators match [versions] depending on their [core].

- They MUST be denoted by an OPTIONAL [comparison operator] and one or two
  REQUIRED [shorthand versions].
- They MUST be separated by double-ampersand `&&` or whitespace.
- If no [comparison operator] is specified, then equality `==` is assumed.


###### Comparison Operators

- `==VERSION` MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose [core] has
  *equal precedence to* **VERSION**.

- `!=VERSION` MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose [core] has
  *not equal precedence to* **VERSION**.

- `>VERSION` MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose [core] has
  *greater precedence than* **VERSION**.

- `>=VERSION` MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose [core] has
  *greater than or equal precedence to* **VERSION**.

- `<VERSION` MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose [core] has
  *less precedence than* **VERSION**.

- `<=VERSION` MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose [core] has
  *less than or equal precedence to* **VERSION**.

- `FROM_VERSION - TO_VERSION` MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose [core] has
  *greater than or equal precedence to* **FROM_VERSION** and
  *less precedence than* **TO_VERSION**.

- `~VERSION` MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose [core] has
  *greater than or equal precedence to* **VERSION** and *less precedence than*
  the result of performing a [minor bump] on **VERSION**.

- `^VERSION` MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose [core] has
  *greater than or equal precedence to* **VERSION** and *less precedence than*
  the result of performing a [major bump] on **VERSION**.


###### Shorthand Versions

A shorthand version is a shortened representation of a version [core].

- They MUST NOT contain any [metadata].
- Any occurrence of rightmost dot-separated zeroes `.0` MAY be omitted.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>`1.2` is equivalent to `1.2.0.0`</ins>
> - <ins>`1.2.3` is equivalent to `1.2.3.0`</ins>
> - <ins>`1.2.3.4`</ins>
> - <del>`1.2.3.4-alpha`</del>
> - <del>`1.2.3.4+linux`</del>


##### Release Comparators

Release comparators allow for the inclusion of some [pre-releases].

- A list of release comparators MUST be preceded by a hyphen `-`.

- Each release comparator MUST be denoted by a non-empty, dot-separated, textual
  identifier comprising only alphanumerics and hyphen `[0-9A-Za-z-]`.

- A release comparator MUST be satisfied by a [version] whose
  [release metadata]:
  - is absent, or
  - contains a textual identifier *equal to* this comparator.

> ###### Examples
> - <ins>`-alpha`    is satisfied by     `1.2.3.4`</ins>
> - <ins>`-alpha`    is satisfied by     `1.2.3.4+linux`</ins>
> - <ins>`-alpha`    is satisfied by     `1.2.3.4-alpha.foo`</ins>
> - <del>`-alpha`    is not satisfied by `1.2.3.4-beta`</del>
> - <del>`-beta.foo` is not satisfied by `1.2.3.4-beta`</del>
> - <ins>`-beta.foo` is satisfied by     `1.2.3.4-beta.foo`</ins>


##### Build Comparators

Build comparators favor some [releases] over others, depending on their
[build metadata].

- A list of build comparators MUST be preceded by a plus sign `+`.

- Each build comparator MUST be denoted by a non-empty, dot-separated, textual
  identifier comprising only alphanumerics and hyphen `[0-9A-Za-z-]`.

- A release comparator is always satisfied by any [version] but it SHALL
  influence the nomination if and only if there are several [versions] with the
  greatest precedence:
  - The [version] whose [release metadata] contains more textual identifiers
    *equal to* these comparators MUST be nominated.

### Decision Tree

The next diagram helps determine which number must be incremented when bumping a
new version, by reasoning about the type of modifications that will be released
and their backward-compatibility level.
